    <test>"A few years back, I was in a very challenging situation with my principal and the board. This was a new and unfamiliar experience for me being 20 years into teaching without any such issues from admin.  Right from the start Steve had my back and was someone to count on.   Iâ€™m going to tell you that Steve's support and union leadership really helped me out as this was a very stressful and difficult time.   He approached the situation with empathy, clarity, and a deep understanding of the procedures and policies involved. It was very reassuring that Steve was on my side  doing the hard work and being present and available at a moment's notice.  His communication skills, calm demeanor, and thorough knowledge of union protocol made a significant difference. " </test>
